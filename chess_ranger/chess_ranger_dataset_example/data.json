        "analysis": "The current board situation is:King at b7.Queen at g5.Pawn at e4.Queen at b3.Rook at e2.Pawn at g2.In the process of solving the puzzle, we have 2 operations and 2 flags to analysis:operation Try indicates the execution of a step, operation Backtrack indicates that the capture operation performed by the last Try step is withdrawn; flag Fail indicates all tries have failed in the current case, flag Success indicates that the puzzle is solved.The tried steps after tring option 1 are as follows:Try step 1: move Queen in g5 to capture Rook in g2.Try step 2: move Queen in b3 to capture King in b7.Try step 3: move Queen in b7 to capture Pawn in e4.Try step 4: move Queen in e4 to capture Queen in g2.Success: Only one piece remains.So the option 1 is right.The tried steps after tring option 2 are as follows:Try step 1: move Queen in b3 to capture King in b7.Try step 2: move Queen in b7 to capture Pawn in e4.Try step 3: move Queen in e4 to capture Rook in e2.Try step 4: move Queen in e2 to capture Queen in g2.Success: Only one piece remains.So the option 2 is right.The tried steps after tring option 3 are as follows:Try step 1: move Queen in g5 to capture Pawn in g2.Try step 2: move Queen in b3 to capture King in b7.Try step 3: move Queen in b7 to capture Rook in e4.Try step 4: move Queen in e4 to capture Queen in g2.Success: Only one piece remains.So the option 3 is right.The tried steps after tring option 4 are as follows:Try step 1: move Queen in b7 to capture Pawn in e4.Try step 2: move Queen in g5 to capture Pawn in g2.Try step 3: move Queen in e4 to capture Rook in e2.Try step 4: move Queen in e2 to capture Queen in g2.Success: Only one piece remains.So the option 4 is right.So the answer is 1234.So the answer letter is G.",
